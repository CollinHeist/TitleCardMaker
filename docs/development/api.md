# The API

The TitleCardMaker API is auto-generated, documented, and fully interactable via
the `/docs` and `/redoc` URLs. These are OpenAPI and ReDoc API documentations.
An example of each is shown below:

![Interactive API Documentation](../assets/api_doc.png)
![ReDoc API Documentation](../assets/api_redocs.png)

These API endpoints are utilized by the TCM UI to perform all actions, so
examples of how these endpoints are utilized can be found by exploring the TCM
front-end source code.

Contributions to annotate the API and/or the documentation is welcome.

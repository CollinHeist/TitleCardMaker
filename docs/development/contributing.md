# Contributing to TitleCardMaker

This project was created, developed, and is maintained by a solo
non-professional-developer, meaning contributions for all parts of the project
are welcome __and__ encouraged. If you have any experience with Python,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Docker, writing good documentation, or are just full of
good ideas, please contribute!

To contribute, create a fork of the GitHub repository, add your changes, and
then submit a Pull Request to the `web-ui` branch (__not `master`__). For
documentation, it might be easier to just ping me on Discord.

Thanks!

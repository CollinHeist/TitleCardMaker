# Contributing to TitleCardMaker

Contributions are welcome for all parts of the project, including the front- and
back-end, as well as this documentation.

To contribute, create a fork of the GitHub repository, add your changes, and
then submit a Pull Request to the `web-ui` branch (__not `master`__).

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are Title Cards not loading into Emby/Jellyfin/Plex?

A vast majority of the time this is because the Series does not have a library
assigned. If [manually](./new_series.md) adding the Series, then you will need
to manually assign the library. If [Syncing](...) from Sonarr then you need to
make sure the _Library Paths_ setting is correctly filled out _prior_ to
Syncing.

If you have verified the Series has a library assigned, you can try the
_Force Reload_ button for that server / library.

# User Guide

!!! warning "Under Construction"

    This documentation is actively being developed.

!!! warning "Not for New Users"

    The User Guide __is not__ intended to be an introduction to TitleCardMaker
    for new users - it is a detailed reference for those already familiar with
    the basics. New users should follow the
    [Getting Started](../getting_started/index.md) tutorial.

The TitleCardMaker interface is separated into various pages which can be
navigated to via the sidebar or buttons on the header. Each page is detailed
below:

- [Series](./series.md)
- [Adding Series](./new_series.md)
- [Templates](./templates.md)
- [Fonts](./fonts.md)
- [Sync](./syncs.md)
- [Settings](./settings.md)
- [Connections](./connections.md)
<!-- - [Scheduler](./scheduler.md) -->
<!-- - [Importer](./importer.md) -->
- [Logs](./logs.md)

# Local Linux Installation
## Background
Installing TitleCardMaker locally, instead of in a Docker container,
requires a few additional pieces of software, these are:

- Python
- git (_recommended_)
- Pip
- Pipenv
- ImageMagick

The installation of these, as well as TitleCardMaker itself, will be
covered in this step.


## Instructions
### Installing Python

??? tip "Python Already Installed?"

    If you believe Python is already installed, you can quickly check
    this (and that you have a suitable version), by running the
    following command:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    This should output _at least_ `Python 3.9`.

1. Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/),
and download the installer for the latest version of Python 3.10.
2. Run the installer, and make sure to select the `Add to PATH`
checkbox during installation.
3. Enable PowerShell scripts by following [these](https://windowsloop.com/enable-powershell-scripts-execution-windows-10) instructions.

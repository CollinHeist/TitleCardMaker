# Local Linux Installation

!!! warning "Linux Compatability"

    Some Linux distros __do not__ support ImageMagick - which is a
    requirement for TitleCardMaker - in this case the [Docker
    installation](../docker/index.md) is required.

## Background
Installing TitleCardMaker locally, instead of in a Docker container,
requires a few additional pieces of software, these are:

- Python
- git (_recommended_)
- Pip
- Pipenv
- ImageMagick

The installation of these, as well as TitleCardMaker itself, will be
covered in this step.

## Instructions
### Installing Python

??? tip "Python Already Installed?"

    If you believe Python is already installed, you can quickly check
    this (and that you have a suitable version), by running the
    following command:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    This should output _at least_ `Python 3.9`.

Given the wide diversity of Linux Distros, it is not feasible to cover
the installation of Python in all circumstances. 

If Python is not installed, [this
guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-linux)
covers some common installation methods.

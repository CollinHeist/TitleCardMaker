# Configuring Connections

TitleCardMaker can communicate directly with Emby, Jellyfin, Plex, Sonarr,
Tautulli, and TMDb to get episode data, download images, add translations, and
load Title Cards.

Although not required to run TCM, enabling whichever connections that are
applicable to your setup will improve TCM's operation.

!!! warning "Using Multiple Media Servers"

    Using multiple Media Servers together is _possible_, using [watch-specific
    styles](../../user_guide/settings.md#watched-and-unwatched-episode-styles)
    will require enabling the global [multi-library
    filename](../../user_guide/settings.md#multi-library-filename-support)
    setting in order to properly integrate. Carefully read the in-UI help text
    and the linked documentation before enabling this.

Use the sidebar to find the instructions to set up the connections for each type
of server.

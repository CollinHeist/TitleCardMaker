# Configuring Connections
TitleCardMaker can communicate directly with Emby, Jellyfin, Plex, Sonarr,
Tautulli, and TMDb to get episode data, download images, add translations, and
load Title Cards.

Although not required to run TCM, enabling whichever connections that are
applicable to your setup will improve TCM's operation.

!!! warning "Using Multiple Media Servers"

    Although using multiple Media Servers together is _possible_, using
    [watch-specific styles]() will not integrate well if the two Servers have
    different watch statuses for a given Episode.

Use the sidebar to find the instructions to set up the connections for each type
of server.

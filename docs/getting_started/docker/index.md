# Getting Started - Docker Tutorial

Docker is a very convenient way of compartmentalizing a piece of software, in
this case TitleCardMaker, from the rest of your host machine. It also has the
benefit of coming pre-packaged with all the required dependent software, making
installation much easier.

Because of this, Docker is the recommended installation method for all Operating
Systems.

For [UnRAID](../docker/unraid.md) and [Synology DSM](../docker/synology.md)
users, there are OS-specific tutorials written to walk you through the
installation process. All other systems should follow the
[standard tutorial](../docker/docker.md).

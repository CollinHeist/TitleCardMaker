    How to install TitleCardMaker (and all of the dependencies) inside a Docker 
    container.

# Docker Installation

Docker is a very convenient way of compartmentalizing a piece of software
(TitleCardMaker) from the rest of your host machine - like a very lightweight
Virtual Machine. The TCM Container has the benefit of coming pre-packaged with
all the required dependent software; making installation much easier and less
error-prone.

For these reasons, Docker is the recommended installation method for all
Operating Systems.

For [UnRAID](./unraid.md) and [Synology DSM](./synology.md) users, there are
OS-specific tutorials written to walk you through the installation process. All
other systems should follow the [standard tutorial](../docker/docker.md). There
is also a starter [docker compose](./compose.md) file.

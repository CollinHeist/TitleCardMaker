# Settings

For most users the default Settings can be left as-is with the exception of the
_Episode Data Source_ and _Image Source Priority_ settings, which must be set.
If you'd like to adjust these, additional detail can be found
[here](../user_guide/settings.md).

I also recommend clicking through the various options of the Default Card Type
dropdown and picking your favorite style. The most popular choices are the
Tinted Frame and Standard.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the recommended settings can be found in
[the user guide](../user_guide/settings.md#recommended-settings).

[^1]: Only include the Connections which you are personally using.

[^2]: Feel free to reduce this to some ratio of 16:9 (e.g. 1600:900) if you want
to save storage space (at the minor cost of image fidelity). Increasing this is
not recommended.

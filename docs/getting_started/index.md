# Getting Started

This tutorial is designed to walk you through all of the basics of using
TitleCardMaker. It covers all steps between installing TCM through creating some
example Title Cards.

It is designed for completely new users of TCM, but is still helpful for those
migrating from TCM v1.0 (the command line tool). For more detailed information
about specific aspects of TitleCardMaker, look at the
[User Guide](../user_guide/index.md).

# Syncs

Having manually added a Series to TitleCardMaker, it should be obvious this will
be tedious for any more than a handful of Series. This is where the idea of a
"Sync" comes in.

Syncing allows Series to be automatically added to TCM. You can Sync from any
non-TMDb connection, each Snc can be customized to only add filtered subsets of
your Series, and can also automatically assign specific Card customizations
(through [Templates]()).

For most users, I recommend to Sync from [Sonarr](./sonarr.md). However, if you
are not using Sonarr, then your primary Media Server is the next-best option.

# Welcome to TitleCardMaker
TitleCardMaker is a program and Docker container written in Python that
automates the creation of customized title cards for use in personal
media server services like Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby.

??? question "What is a Title Card?"

    A Title Card is a thumbnail image for an Episode used to add a
    unique look within a personal media server like Plex, Jellyfin, or
    Plex. Some Series have "official" Title Cards featured in the
    Episode itself.

TitleCardMaker can be automated such that everything can be done without
manual intervention. All your series can be read from your media server
or Sonarr; episode data can be pulled from Sonarr, your media server, or
TheMovieDatabase; images from TheMovieDatabase, or your media server;
and TitleCardMaker can even utilize an episode's watch status to create
"spoiler free" versions of title cards automatically, as shown below:
